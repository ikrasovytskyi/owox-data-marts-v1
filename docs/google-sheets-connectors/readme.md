## ✨ Why We Built This

We believe every **data analyst should have the power to automate data collection** — without begging for engineering help, paying for expensive SaaS tools, or exposing credentials to 3rd party SaaS tools.
We want to empower **every business to become data owners** by importing their data into Spreadsheets or data warehouses.

Here is what Google Sheets Connectors are:

- You can import data to **YOUR** Google Sheets
- Require **no external platforms** or credentials sharing
- Doesn't require **ANY data engineering resources**
- Are 100% open-source and **customizable**
- **Free forever**: your connector - your control

Whether you're an analyst at an agency, a startup, or in a huge enterprise, this project gives you **full control over your data collection connectors**.

This is the starting point for data connectivity, but we also have the **OWOX Data Marts** **[🌐 Cloud](https://app.owox.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=appscriptreadme)** and **[Self-Hosted](../../docs/editions/all-editions.md)** Editions.

## 🧰 How It Works

- 🎯 Pick your platform (e.g. Facebook Ads) from [existing integrations](#-available-connectors)
- 🧾 Make a copy of the Template from the [connectors table](#-available-connectors)
- 🔐 Add your API credentials directly to the sheet — **they stay private**
- 🚀 Run the connector to pull your data
- 📅 Schedule it for interval/daily/weekly refreshes
